# Custom embeds

Although it is possible to embed a typeform by adding an iframe in your page that points to a typeform, we encourage you to use the [Embed SDK](https://developer.typeform.com/embed/). Custom embeds often cause issues like:

- Scrolling problems in older browsers.
- Autofocus "jumps" to the first focusable question.
- User interface flow problems on mobile devices.
- General errors that can break functionality and the user experience.

We do not support or recommend custom embeds.
