# Contributing

[Embed SDK repository on Github](https://github.com/Typeform/embed) is open-source. 

If you find a bug or want to request a new feature [please let us know by opening a new issue](https://github.com/Typeform/embed/issues/new).

You can suggest changes, bugfixes and new features by opening a pull request and we will closely review all suggestions. However we can not promise all pull requests will be merged since this is a shared library used all by all typeform users â€” the feature needs to bring value to other users too. If you need to develop something specific you are welcome to do so in your own fork and we will be happy to help out. We are still working on new features for the Embed SDK ourselves as well, but are opening this possibility to you too.

Don't forget to read the [README file](https://github.com/Typeform/embed/blob/main/README.md) in the repository before contributing. We really appreciate any contributions to the Embed SDK.
