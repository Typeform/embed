# Mobile apps and embedded typeforms

## Progressive web apps

You can use our embed SDK in progressive web apps with wrappers like Capacitor or Cordova. Your app needs to be served over `http://`, `capacitor://` or `ionic://` protocol.

## Native mobile apps

Typeforms can be embedded within iOS and Android apps using [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) components.

---

**NOTE:** Developers have successfully embedded typeforms within WKWebView components, but Typeform doesn't officially support it. If something goes wrong, we cannot offer you any formal assistance.
